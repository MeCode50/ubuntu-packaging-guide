    Application Binary Interface
        Defines how two binary applications interface eachother like calling conventions,
        data type sizes, and system call interfaces, ensuring compatibility and proper
        communication between different parts of a software system, such as libraries,
        executables, and the :term:`Operating System`. *Application Binary Interfaces*
        are crucial for enabling software components compiled on different systems
        to work together seamlessly.

            Do not confuse with :term:`Application Programming Interface` (:term:`API`)!

    Application Programming Interface
        An *Application Programming Interface* (API), is a set of rules that allows
        different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines
        the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange
        information, perform specific tasks, or access the functionality of another
        software component, such as an :term:`Operating System`, library, or online
        service. *APIs* enable developers to build upon existing software and create
        new applications by providing a standardized way to interact with external
        systems, services, or libraries without needing to understand their internal
        workings.

    Circle of Friends

    Ubuntu Developer Summit
        Between 2004 and 2012, :term:`Ubuntu` releases were planned during regularly scheduled
        summits, where the greater :term:`Ubuntu` community would come together for
        planning and hacking sessions. This event occurred two times a year, each one
        running for a week. The discussions were highly technical and heavily influenced
        the direction of the subsequent :term:`Ubuntu` release.

        These events were called *"Ubuntu Developer Summit"* (UDS).

        These events are continued since November 2022 as ":term:`Ubuntu Summit`" (US)
        to include the broader :term:`Ubuntu` community and not only developers.

    Ubuntu Summit
        The *Ubuntu Summit* (US) is a continuation of :term:`Ubuntu Developer Summit`
        since November 2022. The change in name aims to broadening the scope, which
        opens the event up to additional audiences.

        While the :term:`Ubuntu Developer Summit` was focused on technical development,
        the talks and workshops of the *Ubuntu Summit* will cover development as well
        as design, writing, and community leadership with a wide range of technical
        skill levels.
        
        The name also results in a nifty new acronym, *"US"*, or more appropriately,
        simply *"Us"*. This fits very nicely with the meaning of :term:`Ubuntu`,
        *"I am what I am because of who we all are"*.

        `summit@ubuntu.com <mailto:summit@ubuntu.com>`_.
